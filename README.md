# üöÄ Intelligent DAM PoC for HSAD

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for an **Intelligent Digital Asset Management (DAM)** system, built for **HS Ad** utilizing Google Cloud's most advanced AI technologies. It aims to completely automate and intelligently enhance the digital asset lifecycle, transforming a simple storage system into a proactive creative and strategic hub.

This final version includes advanced features like **AI-powered Vector Search** for image similarity matching and a **generative Q&A chatbot (RAG)**, providing a comprehensive, next-generation content management experience.

## 3. System Architecture

This system is built on a fully serverless, event-driven architecture using Google Cloud services, ensuring scalability and cost-efficiency. A central Cloud Function orchestrates all interactions between the user, AI models, and data storage.
